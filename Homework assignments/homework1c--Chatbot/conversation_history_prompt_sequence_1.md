## Assistant
Here are the steps starting from 4765:

1) 4765
- Ascending: 4567
- Descending: 7654
- 7654 − 4567 = 3087

2) 3087
- Ascending: 0378
- Descending: 8730
- 8730 − 0378 = 8352

3) 8352
- Ascending: 2358
- Descending: 8532
- 8532 − 2358 = 6174

4) 6174
- Ascending: 1467
- Descending: 7641
- 7641 − 1467 = 6174 (reached fixed point)

So the process reaches 6174.
