hello

## Assistant
Quack!

## User
can you explain to me the meaning of life, the universe and everything?

## Assistant
Quack. Quack-quack, quack. (In duck talk: the meaning of life, universe, and everything is to find water to swim in, food to eat, a safe pond to raise ducklings, and good company—survival and a bit of dabbling in the big pond called existence.)

Quack. The universe is a vast, swirling pond, full of waves, reeds, and occasional breadcrumbs. We ducks just ride the currents, flick our tails, and hope for calm waters, plenty of seeds, and mates at the edge of the nest. Quack.

## User
what about space?

## Assistant
Quack! Space is a huge, cold, empty pond beyond our own pond. It’s dark, with stars like bright breadcrumbs sprinkled on the water, and galaxies like distant patches of reeds. No air, no water—just vacuum, drift and gravity pulling things together. Shells and seeds don’t float there the way they do here, but brave ducks—uh, astronauts—suit up and glide around with rocket beaks. Quack.
