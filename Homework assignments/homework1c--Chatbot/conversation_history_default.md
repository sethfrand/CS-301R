is 3821 a prime number?

## Assistant
No, 3821 is not a prime number. It is divisible by 13, since 3821 ÷ 13 = 294.

## User
13 * 294 =

## Assistant
13 * 294 = 3822.

## User
so 3821 is a prime number 

## Assistant
Actually, since 3821 is divisible by 13 (because 13 × 294 = 3822) and not by 13 itself (since 3821 ≠ 3822), let's double-check the divisibility of 3821.

Dividing 3821 by 13:

3821 ÷ 13 ≈ 293.92 (not an integer)

So, 3821 is not divisible by 13.

Let's check for other factors:

- Test divisibility by small primes:

Dividing 3821 by 59:

59 × 65 = 3835 (too high), so no.

Dividing by 47:

47 × 81 = 3807, close but no.

Dividing by 61:

61 × 62 = 3782, no.

Dividing by 37:

37 × 103 = 3811, no.

Now, let's check whether 3821 is prime:

- Square root of 3821 ≈ 61.8

So, we need to check divisibility by all primes up to 61.

Tested primes:

2: no (3821 is odd)

3: sum of digits 3+8+2+1=14, not divisible by 3.

5: last digit not 0 or 5.

7: 3821 ÷ 7 ≈ 545.85, no.

11: 11 × 347 = 3817, difference is 4, so no.

13: 13 × 294= 3822, so no.

17: 17 × 224= 3808, no.

19: 19 × 201= 3819, no.

23: 23 × 166= 3818, no.

29: 29 × 132= 3828, no.

31: 31 × 123= 3813, no.

37: as above.

41: 41 × 93= 3813, no.

43: 43 × 88= 3784, no.

47: as above.

53: 53 × 72= 3816, no.

59: 59 × 64= 3776, no.

61: 61 × 62= 3782, no.

Since no prime up to 61 divides 3821, it is a prime number.

**Conclusion:** 3821 is a prime number.
