While listening to Elder Bednars talk, I thought a lot about how
AI, just like everything else in this world is a tool, how we use it is very important. 
This tied really well into the article that I read from Elder Gong when he spoke in Instanbul. I thought it 
was really important that in both instances they talked about the importance of real relationships. 
It is somewhat disturbing the extent to which relying on AI for compantionship has 
become so commonplace. In class, we saw the graphics from a study that was done, those statistics were 
also very disturbing. I read another article that was talking about how many teens are 
turning to AI for everything from homework to health needs. 
I think this is a very important topic to discuss adn something that we need 
to be aware of as we move forward.
